# emotionr package

I developed this package as part of a class in Applied Programming for Data Science. As I'm interested in the role of emotional expression in political discourse, I wanted to develop a package that went beyond either simple negative/positive valence, or the big 7 emotions in the nrc lexicon. 

I started off developing this package for the emotion courage, which I used to build out the basic functionality. Ideally I would like to build out the package to:

Include other emotions, such as hope or narrower definitions of anger than found in the nrc.

Automatically create a tidy data frame with relevant tweets for further analysis.
